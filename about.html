            <p>Baiju Sundar is a passionate poet from the serene landscape of Vellayani in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. His journey into poetry began as a means to express the intricacies of life, love, and nature that surround him. Each poem reflects his thoughts, emotions, and the beauty of his native land.

                Drawing inspiration from the lush greenery of Kerala, the gentle rhythms of life, and the rich cultural heritage that has shaped his worldview, Baiju believes that poetry has the power to connect hearts, transcend boundaries, and evoke deep emotions. Through his words, he aspires to touch the souls of his readers and share the stories that often go untold.
                
                With each verse, Baiju aims to create a tapestry of experiences, inviting readers to explore the depths of human emotion and the beauty of our shared existence. He is thrilled to share his poetic works and hopes they resonate in the hearts of his audience.
